# Project README

## Overview
This project encompasses the design and development of a comprehensive user interface prototype created using Figma. The project was executed over three sprints, focusing on various core features essential for our application. Below is a detailed outline of the features developed during each sprint.

## Sprints Breakdown

### Sprint 1
During the first sprint, our focus was on setting up the foundational components of the application. The key features developed were:

- **Feed**: Design of the main feed where users can view posts.
- **Show Profile**: User profile page showcasing user details and activities.
- **SignIn**: Interface for users to sign in to their accounts.
- **SignUp**: Interface for new users to create accounts.

### Sprint 2
The second sprint aimed at enhancing user interaction and expanding the functionalities. The features developed in this sprint were:

- **Create and Edit Group**: Design of pages for creating and managing user groups.
- **Feed**: Continued refinement and addition of new elements to the main feed.
- **PV (Private Messages)**: Interface for private messaging between users.
- **Topics**: Design of topic pages where users can explore various discussion topics.

### Sprint 3
The third sprint focused on finalizing the design, incorporating user feedback, and ensuring the overall coherence of the interface. Specific features for this sprint were aimed at polishing the existing designs and integrating them seamlessly.
- **Topic group edit**: Interface for editing a topic group info.
- **create topic group info**: Design of topic group info.

## Contribution
Contributions to the project were made collaboratively by our design team, each member focusing on specific components and ensuring the integration of feedback from each sprint cycle.

## Future Work
Future iterations of the project will focus on user testing, further refinement based on feedback, and adding new features as required by user needs.
